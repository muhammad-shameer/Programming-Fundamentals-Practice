# Programming Fundamentals Practice  

This repository contains my practice work for the **Programming Fundamentals** course at university.  
Since I already have prior programming experience, the focus here is on **strengthening fundamentals** through structured exercises in **algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming**.

## 📂 Repo Structure  
- **Algorithms/** → recursion, sorting, searching, etc.  
- **Data-Structures/** → arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees  
- **OOP/** → classes, inheritance, polymorphism, design patterns  
- **Problem-Sets/** → practice problems from platforms like LeetCode & HackerRank  

Each folder may contain example programs, notes, and multiple approaches to solving problems.

## 🛠️ How to Run Code  
- Most examples are written in **C** (with some C++ practice).  
- Run using:  
  ```bash
  gcc filename.c -o filename && ./filename
