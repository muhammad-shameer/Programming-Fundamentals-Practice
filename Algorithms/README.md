# Algorithms  

This folder contains practice problems and examples related to **algorithms**.  
Each program focuses on building problem-solving skills and exploring different approaches.  

---

## 📂 Contents  
- **Recursion/** → factorial, Fibonacci, tower of Hanoi, etc.  
- **Sorting/** → bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort  
- **Searching/** → linear search, binary search  

---

## 🎯 Goals  
- Understand algorithm design and complexity (time/space)  
- Compare iterative vs. recursive approaches  
- Practice writing clean, efficient, and well-structured code  

---

## 📝 Notes  
- Multiple versions of the same algorithm may exist to compare implementations.  
- This folder is part of the larger **Programming Fundamentals Practice** repo.
