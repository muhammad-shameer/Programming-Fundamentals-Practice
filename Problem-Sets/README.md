# Problem Sets  

This folder contains my solutions to practice problems from various online platforms, written in **C/C++**.  
The focus is on applying **programming fundamentals** to solve real-world coding challenges efficiently.  

---

## 📂 Contents  
- **LeetCode/** → problems organized by topic (arrays, strings, recursion, etc.)  
- **HackerRank/** → practice challenges across multiple domains  
- **Codeforces/** → competitive programming problems  
- **Misc/** → problems from coursework, books, or other sources  

---

## 🎯 Goals  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills using C/C++  
- Implement clean and efficient solutions  
- Explore multiple approaches (brute force → optimized)  
- Build consistency with daily/weekly problem-solving

## 📝 Notes  
- Each file follows the naming convention:  
`<platform>_<problem-name>.<ext>`
- `platform` → `leetcode`, `hackerrank`, `codeforces`, `misc`  
- `problem-name` → lowercase, words separated by `_`  
- `ext` → `.c` or `.cpp`  

- ✅ Examples:  
- `leetcode_two_sum.cpp`  
- `leetcode_binary_tree_inorder_traversal.cpp`  
- `hackerrank_dynamic_array.c`  
- `codeforces_next_round.cpp`  
- `misc_factorial_recursive.c`  

- Problem statements are usually included as comments at the top of the file.  
- Some problems may have multiple implementations (e.g., recursive vs. iterative).
